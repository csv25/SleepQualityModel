# SleepQualityModel
As a busy graduate student, I have noticed that my stress levels have increased. This has affected my sleep quality in the past months. Therefore, I want to research what are the factors that affect my sleep quality using my Garmin watch data.


Questions:
• What factors predict a full 8 hour of sleep schedule?
• On average, how many hours of sleep do I get each night?
• What is the quality of my sleep?
• Are there any trends or changes in my sleep patterns over time?

Helpful definitions to understand before reading analysis.
Definitions from Garmin regarding sleep:
- Rem Sleep: “REM sleep is considered the final stage of a sleep cycle. Dreams are common during REM sleep. REM sleep stages tend to start short and grow longer throughout the night. The REM sleep stage is believed to be when your brain has a chance to process and make sense of data. It may even be linked to how you learn new skills.”
- Deep Sleep: “As you transition to deep sleep, eye and muscle movements stop completely. Your heart rate and breathing slow. At this point, you become difficult to rouse and are disoriented if awakened. It’s generally agreed that deep sleep has a myriad of health benefits. For example, it helps aid muscle recovery.”
- Awake Sleep: “In general, it’s best for sleep to be continuous through the night, with few to no stretches of awake time.”
- Light Sleep: “Light sleep is the first stage of sleep. Eye movements and muscle activity slow during light sleep as your body gets ready for deep sleep.”
